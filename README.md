# Deep Learning Project - MNIST Classification

> By Ahmad EL KAAKOUR and Matthieu RANDRIANTSOA

This project explores various deep learning approaches to tackle the MNIST classification problem. We experimented with different model architectures, optimized them, and recorded their performance to compare results. The goal is to demonstrate the impact of different neural network designs and hyperparameters on model accuracy and efficiency.

This repository contains everything you need to dive into the project:

- A project report in PDF format
- Implementation notebooks, with each section (Shallow Network, Deep Network and CNN with transfer learning) in its own file for easy exploration
- A results visualization file to quickly review the outcomes

Pre-trained models are saved in the models folder, and the data folder holds JSON files with training results for reference.

_Please note that this work is part of my curriculum in machine learning._
